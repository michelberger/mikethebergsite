		<h1 class="intro-title">Hello Shopify!</h1>
		<h2 class="intro-me">My name is <span>Michel Bergeron</span>,</h2>
		<h2>and I would love to intern for you this summer!</h2>
		<br>
		<div id="intro-body">
			<p>I am a third-year Honours Computer Science student at Carleton University, specializing in Network Computing.
			I attended your conference at Carleton University back in January, and I just knew that I would love to call
			Shopify my home, and its many employees my friends over the upcoming summer! I would be honoured to be a part of what
			is happening over at Shopify; if even for a few months.</p>
			<p>Being the eCommerce giant that you are, it is impressive that you can provide easy-to-use tools for small startups
			(I've personally used <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mightycarmods.com/">MightyCarMods'</a> website; the experience was
			flawless), as well as being the choice for other giants like Encyclopedia Britannica and General Electric. This is definitely
			something to be proud of, and a reason why I would be proud to call myself a shopify member.</p>
			<p>I believe that joining the team at Shopify will give me the most direct exposure to the standards which today's companies
			<span>should</span> meet in terms of efficiency and as a professional community, in order to gain the most acute skills for
			tomorrow's web development.</p>

			<h2>So what am I made of?</h2>
			<p>Sugar! Well, only partly...</p>
			<p>I have experience both in frontend and backend development. As you read this, I'm developing an open source software system for
			the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, which you can check out the progress on
			<a target="_blank" href="/gaugecluster">here</a>.</p>
			<p>I have yet to develop professionally, however I did lead a team of 4 software engineering students in a 4 month long term-project
			to develop a Teaching Assistant Evaluation software system. My academic experiences stretch across C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Scheme,
			SQLite, Node.js, and eating lots of spicy foods. My Gauge Cluster application will soon come to use Python for its I/O communications,
			and as you read this I am working to recreate this website to use MySQL and PHP (unfortunately GoDaddy no longer supports Rails),
			as well as completely redesign it (it could always be better, right?).</p>
			<p>I have a few projects that I would also like to get underway! I am planning on creating an n-ary converter with Python, as well
			as teaming up with friends to create an online music-streaming service (the latter being private between developers ... more of a
			personal proof-of-concept than anything). I am also excited to dip my toes into the realm of mobile app development, and possibly
			game development!</p>
		</div>

		<div id="interests">
			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<p>I would love to join your team of API developers, iOS and other App developers, or Internal Tools developers!</p>
			<p>The market is definitely turning to the web, and in particular mobile web, so I would be more than thrilled to learn the
			skills to keep up. I feel as though I haven't learned nearly enough through university, and trying to code up a storm in the
			comfort of my own home can only get me so far. The exposure to the great minds that Shopify clearly offers will be the right
			thing to get me on my way!</p>
